      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Sarah Gery. Over the course of this semester, I’ve had the opportunity to learn all about data and just how much it is a part of digital media. Below is a compilation of various projects that I have had to do throughout the semester involving both data and digital media. This is my Datastory.

          <h3>Data Collection</h3>
          <p>
            Ah the Data Collection. This was the first project that I had to complete near the beginning of the semester. For this project, I was required to pick a topic that related to my everyday digital habits. I had to make sure that I picked a topic that best suited my lifestyle and allowed me to collect at least 10 individual observations each day. There were a lot of options to choose from, but I decided on the topic of phone app usage. With my topic chosen, I began collecting data every day for five days straight. I then inserted all of my observations into a spreadsheet and color coded them to separate the individual days. The image on the left, is example of my first day’s observations. It was weird having to take time out of each of the five days to record the data of every single app I used on my phone. While it was a bit weird to do, it was interesting to see what apps I used throughout those five days of observations. This project taught me how to analyze and explain how personal digital habits are implicated in broader social and political digital practices. This project also began to teach me about just how much digital data and digital media affected my everyday life.

          <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
          <p>
            The next project was the Data Visualization. The Data Visualization was based on the data that I collected when I was working on the Data Collection project. I completed this project near the middle of the semester. During this project, I learned how to use Inkscape in order to create a visual representation of the data I collected in the Data Collection. Throughout the process of completing this project, I learned how to make sound design decisions, how to represent data visually, and how to draw with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs). I also learned about basic types of charts, the fundamentals of marks and attributes for charts, and then how to draw SVGs in Inkscape. Kirk’s text <i>Data Visualization: A Handbook for Data Driven Design</i> was the perfect source for learning chart types and the fundamentals of marks and attributes. Completing the Data Visualization helped me to understand how to provide a simple, clear representation of my digital data that my audience would be able to understand.

          <h3>Explained Video</h3>
          <p>
            And finally, the Explained Video. The Explained Video was the third project that I needed to complete during my semester’s work. This was my final project before putting everything together on a website as my Datastory. At the beginning of the semester I began learning about the connection between ethics and digital data. Young’s text <i>List cultures: Knowledge and poetics from Mesopotamia to Buzzfeed</i> discusses how technical documents have ethically changed and developed over time in different cultures. Young also refers listing techniques and how organizations write algorithms to collect and use data about peoples' ideas and lives. I have been able to take what I have learned through Young’s reading and apply this knowledge to the Explained Video project. For this project, I was teamed up with two other students in my class. We were required to come up with an ethical issue in relation to digital data and digital media. My group ended up deciding on the ethical issues with the recommendation engine on Amazon. We focused on the algorithms that Amazon uses when recommending products for its users. We found a lot of really strong, good information that supported the ethical issues surround Amazon’s recommendation system. It was actually kind of scary to see just how much data Amazon collects from its users. I have a link to the video my group created underneath the image.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        I’ve really enjoyed working on these various projects throughout the semester. Every single one of the projects listed above built up the completion of the Datastory. I wish we had time to learn more, but all good things must come to an end at some point. If I had to pick my favorite thing that I learned this semester, it would be learning HTML coding. Even if we did just learn the basics, I had a lot of fun with it. This is the end of my Datastory.
